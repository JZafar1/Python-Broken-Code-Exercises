# Python Tutorials
Python exercises, tutorials and projects for learning Python fundamentals.
<br>
This project has been created to help T-Level students learn Python fundamentals and covers most of the core content 
required for the "T-Level Digital Design and Development" course as of January 2022. 

## Installation

### Dependencies

Python-Tutorials requires:
- Python (>= 3.9)
- NumPy (>= 1.21.2)
- Matplotlib (>= 3.5.1)
- Pandas (>= 1.3.3)
- requests (>= 2.26.0)

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda install --file requirements.txt` to install the required libraries.


# Usage
The course is designed to be taught over ten weeks, with exercises gradually getting more difficult. The solutions for 
each exercises have been provided. Some exercises have multiple example solutions. In such cases, the solutions have been 
named `exercise_n_m.py` where _n_ denotes the exercise number and _m_ denotes the solution number. See below for a summary 
of the content covered in each week.

## Week 1
Week 1 contains 10 exercises covering Python fundamentals. This is a good starting point if you are completely new to 
Python.

## Week 2
There are 10 exercises in week 2. The exercises are more difficult than Week 1, but still only cover Python fundamentals. 
The twenty exercises in weeks 1 and 2 are a useful way to gauge how well you understand core Python concepts. 
If you struggle with these exercises, it is advised that you complete some more Python content to master these concepts 
before moving on.

## Week 3
Week 3 focuses on NumPy. A brief NumPy tutorial is provided in the `Introduction to NumPy` directory which is a useful 
teaching resource that covers NumPy fundamentals and illustrates how using NumPy can deliver great performance 
enhancements when used correctly.

## Week 4
In week 4, we cover some Pandas fundamentals. The exercises for this week assume some basic knowledge of Pandas. Some 
exercises require processing data from an external source, whilst others focus on writing new functionality that 
builds on existing solutions.

## Week 5

The exercises in Week 5 focus on Python classes and Tkinter. Some exercises require building a solution from a problem 
description, whilst others focus on fixing and improving existing Tkinter code. An understanding of Python classes is a 
prerequisite for these exercises.

## Week 6

Week 6 focuses on Matplotlib, and revisits some basic data manipulation techniques covered in the NumPy and 
Pandas tutorials. If this is the first time you have used Matplotlib then a Matplotlib tutorial has been provided in 
Jupyter Notebook and PDF formats.

## Weeks 7 - 10

The first six weeks of this course should have consolidated your knowledge of Python fundamentals, and introduced the 
fundamental features of Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. In this final section of the course, you are encouraged to work 
on a project that will help consolidate your 

## Revision Exercises

The `revision` directory provides additional content closely related to the content covered in the first six weeks of the 
course. Most of the exercises build on the Pandas fundamentals covered in week four, using the knowledge gained from those 
exercises to build a Pandas based project.
