# Exercise 8
# We now have a fully functional stock management system...
# Let's now add some user interaction to make it more useful.

# Task 1: Add functionality to the main function that can call the correct
#   function based on the user input. 0 should call run_store, 1 should call
#   update_price, 2 should call add_product, 3 should call exit_store. Note if
#   the user enters "3" we should break out of the while loop after calling the
#   exit_store function.

# Task 2: Many of the new functions users can interact with have no
#   implementation yet. Implement the update_price, add_product, and exit_store
#   functions using the specification provided in each function.
