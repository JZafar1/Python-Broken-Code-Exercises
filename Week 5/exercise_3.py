# Exercise 3
# In this exercise we will create a higher or lower game.
# Create a class called HigherOrLower that take as arguments the upper bound,
# and number of rounds
# Create a function called play which runs the game. The play function should:
#   1 - generate a random number and after outputting the number to the console,
#       ask the user whether they would like to go Higher or Lower - you should
#       require the user to specify the full word i.e. H/L is not valid.
#   2 - Generate a new number and if the user guessed correctly, increase the
#       round by one and inform the user they passed the current round.
#   3 - Repeat steps 1 and 2 until either the user guesses incorrectly, or the
#       round limit is reached and write a sensible message to the console
#       informing the user of the outcome of the game.
