# Exercise 5
# In this exercise we will generate random customer data to
# add to a pandas DataFrame. We would like to get some
# statistics about the customer information that has been
# generated. For example the select_by_spend() function will
# print all customers who have an average spend about a given value.
# Can you implement the function get_customer_by_type()?

# Extension: Can you print the average spend of all customer combined?

# Further extension: Can you change the generate_customer_data() function
# to generate and return a DataFrame object?
