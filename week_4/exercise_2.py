# Exercise 2
# In this exercise we will read a list of products that a shop
# sells from a CSV file. The CSV contains 3 columns "product",
# "price" and "tax". "tax" is Y or N, if Y then 20% tax should
# be added to the original price.
# The function compute_total() will select 3 products at random
# from the store and should output the total price after tax.

# Extension: Can you add a function that is optional and asks the
# user if they would like to add a product to the store?
