# Exercise 1

# Create a class called Person.
# The class should take 2 parameters, the name and age of the person.
# Create two functions within the class:
#   - The first should be called age_difference and take an argument of
#     another Person and return the difference in their ages
#   - The second should return a string representation of the person,
#     something like: Your name is {name} and you are {age} years old
# Then create a "main" function outside of the class which is invoked
# everytime the file is run. It should ask for the name/age of the
# person running the file, and create a second arbitrary person with
# any values. Check that you can print the string representation of
# your person correctly, and print the age difference between the input
# person and the fake person.
